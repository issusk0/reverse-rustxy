#TODO: Start a server
#TODO: Implement Rustxy
#TODO: Rustxy must handle requests and redirect them to the servers specified in the Rustxy configuration.
#TODO: Rustxy must send responses to clients showing the IP address of the server Rustxy used as a reverse proxy.
#TODO: Rustxy must mark a server as "unreachable" if it fails health checks a total of 5 times consecutively, and therefore should not send requests to that server for the next 10 minutes.
